#labels ISA

= AMD64 =

The capability to include instructions with 32-bit or 16-bit addressing is present, but by default we don't. 

Once the AMD4RawAssembler and AM64LabelAssembler have been generated, this package can be used separate from the framework by importing the following assembler packages only:

 * jasm
 * jasm.x86
 * jasm.amd64
