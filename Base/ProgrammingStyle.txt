Naming conventions
------------------

Interfaces and classes start with an upper case letter, e.g. MyClass, YourInterface.

Methods start with a lower case letter, e.g. foo, fooBar, yourMethodIsNotCalledFooBar.

Private, protected and non-final public fields start with "_",
followed by a lower case letter, e.g. _myField, _offset.

Public final fields are all upper case (with "_" word delimiters), e.g. ALL_UPPER_CASE.

There are certain exceptions, which always have to do with interactions with pre-existing
structures outside our software (e.g. JNI, assembler syntax).

"..._Type" - type parameter, same as classes and interfaces, except for the suffix,
             e.g. Element_Type, MethodActor_Type.

"numberOf..." - the number of given things as in counting them

"size" - measure of bytes, referring to a sequential span
"length" - measure of units of whatever (e.g. integers, floats, boats, yachts), referring to a sequential span

"offset" - measure of bytes, referring to a position
"index" - measure of units of whatever, referring to a position
"scale" - unit size in bytes

Concerning pointer/reference/grip/accessor operations:

"read", "write" - access by byte offset
"get", "set"    - access by index with scale (and displacement)

"load"  - generalization of "read" and "get"
"store" - generalization of "write" and "set"
