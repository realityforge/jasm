#summary Overview of the build framework.

= Building =

The project uses [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] as the build tool for the project. Running the `ant` command in the base directory of the project will build, unit test and package the system. Below are the available build targets;

{{{
$ ant -projecthelp
Buildfile: build.xml

Main targets:

 clean                Clean the output directory
 clobber              Remove all generated artifacts.
 compile              Compile the code
 compile-tests        Compile the code
 generate-assemblers  Generate the assemblers
 main                 Compile, package and test the code
 package              Package the code
 unit-tests           Run the test cases
Default target: main

}}}

It should be noted that if you need to regenerate the assemblers (after changing the generation classes) that you will need to run `ant clobber` to delete the existing generated files before running the `ant` command again.
