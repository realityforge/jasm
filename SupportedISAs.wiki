#summary Overview of supported instruction set architectures

= Supported ISAs =

The project supports several different instruction set architectures (ISAs). These are IA32, PowerPC, AMD64 and SPARC. 

After the `RawAssembler` and `LabelAssembler` has been generated by jasm, the number of files required to use the ISA specific assembler and disassembler is relatively small.  Assemblers require the following packages;

  * `jasm`
  * `jasm.util`
  * `jasm.<isa>`
  * `jasm.<isa>.as`
  * `jasm.<isa>.dis` (for the disassembler)
  * `jasm.dis` (for the disassembler)

The PowerPC and SPARC ISAs also require `jasm.risc` while the IA32 and AMD64 ISAs require  `jasm.x86` and `jasm.x86.dis` (for the disassembler).

#summary Assembly system for (almost all of) the IA32 instruction set.

== IA32 ==

The assembly system for (almost all of) the [http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm IA32 instruction set] has the added restriction that the default address and operand size is ALWAYS 32 bits.

#summary Assembly system for AMD 64 processors in "64-bit mode"

== AMD64 ==

The assembly system for AMD 64 processors in "64-bit mode" has the capability to include instructions with 32-bit or 16-bit addressing but by default does not. 

#summary Assembly system for SPARC

== SPARC ==

The SPARC assembly system was developed according to this book: [http://www.sparc.com/standards/SPARCV9.pdf The SPARC Architecture Manual - Version 9], edited by David L. Weaver and Tom Germond, published by Prentice Hall, 1994.

== PowerPC ==

The PowerPC assembly system requires documentation.
