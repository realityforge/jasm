= IA32 =

An assembly system for (almost all of) the IA32 instruction set. Our own restriction here: the default address and operand size is ALWAYS 32 bits.

We have the capability to include instructions with 16-bit addressing, but by default we don't.

Once IA32RawAssembler and IA32LabelAssembler have been generated, this package can be used separate from the framework by importing the following assembler packages only:

 * jasm
 * jasm.x86
 * jasm.ia32
