= IA32 =

An assembly system for (almost all of) the [http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm IA32 instruction set]. Our own restriction here: the default address and operand size is ALWAYS 32 bits.

Once IA32RawAssembler and IA32LabelAssembler have been generated, this package can be used separate from the framework by importing the following assembler packages only:

 * jasm
 * jasm.x86
 * jasm.ia32
