History of significant changes

* jasm, Version 1.0 Release Notes (Future)

NOTE: This is the release notes for the first version of the project. As such they
are relatively sparse. The main changes involved refactoring the code base to remove
use of the custom collection framework and other non-essential or unused code. The
refactoring also focused on simplifying the codebase where possible to reduce the
cost of future maintanence. The aim was not to introduce major functional changes in
this release. The code also saw significant performance improvements.

** Enhancement
    * [ 1] - Add Ant script to build and test project. See http://code.google.com/p/jasm/wiki/Building
    * [ 8] - AssemblerTesters are now driven by a command line application rather than a JUnit
             test. See http://code.google.com/p/jasm/wiki/Testing for further details.
    * [16] - Guard constraint checking in assemblers by Config.ENABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS to make it
             easy to disable in performance sensitive scenarios.
    * [17] - Remove some inefficencies that exist in the way the assembler generates machine code. Rather
             than copying the data multiple times through a synchronized methods the machine code is copied
             once into the output array. The code runs in 60% of the time when assemblying small machine
             code arrays and much much faster for larger machine code arrays.
    * [18] - Mark methods in the ia32 and amd64 assemblers with @Inline if they SHOULD be inlined
    * [19] - Pass symbolic operands by value rather than by reference within the ia32 assembler

** Task
    * [03] - IDE specific artifacts have been removed
    * [04] - Base and Assembler modules merged into a single module and single source tree
    * [05] - Repackage source code into package hierarchy jasm. Assemblers are now generated into
             jasm.<isa>.as, diassemblers live in jasm.<isa>.dis
    * [13] - Add a basic example in examples/ directory
    * [14] - Add basic documentation to wiki at http://code.google.com/p/jasm/wiki/Overview
